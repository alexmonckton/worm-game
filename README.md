# Welcome to the Worm Game
There are 2 gamemodes:
- Normal
- Apple Lovers

In Apple Lovers mode there are a lot more apples


Controls:
WASD or arrow keys to move

Hold leftshift to dig underground


Whilst digging you will move underneath yourself and obstacles (but will also move underneath apples not collecting them). The energy bar in the top right shows your energy and will go down whilst digging. Once empty you can no longer dig, but eating apples will replenish energy.
